# 01 ‚Äì Setup and Preparation

> üß™ This document outlines the initial setup process for building the Wazuh SIEM lab, including system preparation, network layout, script usage, and key configuration steps.

## üñ•Ô∏è Lab Environment

The lab was built using local virtual machines and a router on a bridged network. All components are isolated from the internet to simulate an offline enterprise-style environment.

### üíª Machines Used

| Machine            | Role              | OS         | Notes                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Wazuh Manager      | SIEM Server       | Ubuntu(VM)     | Runs Wazuh manager, dashboard |
| Victim Machine     | Monitored Endpoint| Windows 11(VM) | Sends logs to the manager              |
| Kali VM  | Attacker Simulation| Kali Linux | Used for MITM and testing (offline)    |

## üåê Network Setup

- Both Virtual machines are on the same **bridged network** to allow communication through the physical router.
- The router is disconnected from the internet to simulate a secure local environment.
- Each VM is assigned a static IP for easy reference and firewall rule enforcement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Steps

### 1. Wazuh Manager Setup

Go to the official Wazuh Page and follow the instructions to download the wazuh manager. For reference I used the quickstart option to install all the central wazuh components.

Once everything is installed use the admin creditentials given to log into the wazuh dashboard. It should look similar to the image below.
