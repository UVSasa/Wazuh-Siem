## üñ•Ô∏è Lab Environment

The lab was built using local virtual machines and a router on a bridged network. All components are isolated from the internet to simulate an offline enterprise-style environment.

### üíª Machines Used

| Machine            | Role              | OS         | Notes                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Wazuh Manager      | SIEM Server       | Ubuntu     | Runs Wazuh manager, filebeat, dashboard |
| Victim Machine     | Monitored Endpoint| Windows 11 | Sends logs to the manager              |
| Kali VM (optional) | Attacker Simulation| Kali Linux | Used for MITM and testing (offline)    |

## üåê Network Setup

- All machines are on the same **bridged network** to allow communication through the physical router.
- The router is disconnected from the internet to simulate a secure local environment.
- Each VM is assigned a static IP for easy reference and firewall rule enforcement.

### 1. Wazuh Manager Setup

Go to the official Wazuh Page and follow the instructions to download the wazuh manager. For your reference I used the quickstart option to install the central wazuh components.
