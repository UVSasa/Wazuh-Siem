# Wazuh EDR Lab

Welcome to my Wazuh-based Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) lab! This repository documents my hands-on journey in building and managing a cyber defense lab using the open-source tools **Wazuh**. The goal is to go beyond textbook knowledge and develop practical 

The goal of this lab is to strengthen my skills in cyber defense. With these skills translating to real-world applcation in areas like:
- practical SIEM configuration
- Noise Reduction & Alert Prioritization
- Log Source Integration
- Mapping & Understanding Network Environments

## Lab Overview

**Architecture**  
This lab simulates a corporate network with multiple virtual machines monitored by a Wazuh manager:

- **Wazuh Manager** on Ubuntu (log collection, analysis, rules)
- **Windows 10/11 VM** (victim machine, Wazuh Agent installed)
- **Kali Linux VM** (offensive simulation)
- **Mac host system** (also monitored)
- **Wazuh Dashboard** (Elastic Stack integration)

See [architecture/](architecture/) for diagrams and deployment notes.
